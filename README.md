Speel Lake sockeye salmon S-R analysis updated in 2019. 
Speel Lake is located on mainland Alaska, in the Speel Arm of Port Snettisham, approximately 50 km southeast of Juneau, Alaska. Speel Lake sockeye salmon are harvested in traditional mixed stock commercial drift gillnet fisheries in District 11 and in terminal hatchery fisheries in Speel Arm. Escapements have been enumerated annually at an adult counting weir at the outlet of the lake in all but two years since 1983 (the weir has been operated by Douglas Island Pink and Chum, Inc. since 1996). Weir counts during most of the 1980s and 1990s underestimated the escapement, however, due to early removal of the weir. Speel Lake harvests have been estimated annually in conjunction with U.S./Canada stock identification programs to allocate harvests in the District 11 drift gillnet fisheries. 

## Escapement Goals and Stock Status:  
The Speel Lake sockeye salmon run was managed for informal escapement goals of 10,000 fish in the 1980s, then 5,000 fish starting in 1992. In 2003, ADF&G established a biological escapement goal range of 4,000–13,000 sockeye salmon, the range of escapements estimated to provide for greater than 80% of maximum sustained yield (Riffe and Clark 2003). Riffe and Clark (2003) recommended the Speel Lake weir continue to be operated through late September to ensure complete enumeration of the escapement and recommended the escapement goal be reviewed once sufficient new information had been collected. Heinl et al. (2014) reviewed and updated Speel Lake sockeye salmon stock assessment information and updated the stock-recruit analysis. As a result, the goal was changed to a sustainable escapement goal range of 4,000–9,000 fish, based on the range of escapements estimated to provide for 70–80% of maximum sustained yield. A recent review (2019 analysis) suggests the escapement goal should remain unchanged (include reference to escapement goal report not yet published). From 2015 to 2019, escapements were below the escapement goal range in 1 of 5 years.
