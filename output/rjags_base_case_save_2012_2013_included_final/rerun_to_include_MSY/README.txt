MSY was not in the original code or output. Therefore, the model was rerun to include this parameter. 
To match with reports and documents, use the values from the output sheet and the MSY from this sheet (although they are very close).
in the excel workbook " state_space_model_output_Speel_Lake_including_2012_2013," see output_rerun sheet for MSY value and CI.
Otherwise, use the parameter values from the output sheet and from the folder C:\Speel_Lake_sockeye\output\rjags_base_case_save_2012_2013_included_final (statsquants, quaniltes_lambert, percentiles etc).
